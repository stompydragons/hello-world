# Python Fundementals

This was a course from Pluralsight that I really enjoyed. It included a lot of basic Python concepts and it explained the logic behind a lot of them, so I learned why it worked that way. The sections on ideas around shallow copying and why it's important were particularly useful and well done.

And they explained why tuple unpacking is so useful, which also means I recognise it being used in other people's code and can understand why it's been done that way.

The couchdb_restaurant.py code isn't something I wrote for the course, but it's something I put together to play with at the time I was taking the course, which is why it ended up here. It's just me tinkering with a bit of code to play with a local install of CouchDB but it was a big step for me - finding and installing a library on my own and working out a bit of how it works felt like an important stage to reach.
