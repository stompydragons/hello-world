# stompy-learns

Hello!

I'm database/ETL developer for a large insurance company, working on an Oracle/Unix platform. With all the exciting developments happening the world of data and data science, I'm in the process of learning Python and various data science techniques, and this is the repository where I'll be backing up and versioning my code as I go. Hopefully I'll be able to look back on this over the years and see my progress.

This is also a chance for me to get familiar with git and GitHub, which is very different from the PVCS version control I've been buried in for the last decade.
