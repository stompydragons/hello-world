# KJ's Learning Curve

I've worked as a database/ETL developer for for over ten years, primarily working on an Oracle/Unix platform. I'm in the process of learning Python and various data science and new data engineering techniques to keep my skills current (and because it's fun). This is the repository where I'll be backing up and versioning my code as I go. Hopefully I'll be able to look back on this over the years and see my progress.

This is also a chance for me to get familiar with git and GitHub, which is very different from the PVCS version control I've been buried in for the last decade.

Folder list:

* [01_babysteps](https://github.com/stompydragons/stompy-learns/tree/master/01_babysteps "baby steps folder") - The very first python scripts I ever wrote, including the classic "Hello World".

* [02_PythonGettingStarted](https://github.com/stompydragons/stompy-learns/tree/master/02_PythonGettingStarted "Python getting Started folder") - The first course I officially took on Python, so the code is slightly more sophisticated than the baby steps folder but not by much!

* [03_PythonFundementals](https://github.com/stompydragons/stompy-learns/tree/master/03_PythonFundementals "Python Fundementals folder") - My second official Python course, which took me to some much more sophisticated places.
