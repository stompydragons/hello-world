# hello-world

Hello!

I'm an Oracle database developer for a large insurance company. For "fun" I am learning python and data analysis, so I can branch out a bit in my skills. I used PVCS at work and we're just transitioning over to svn, which is very different. So for my personal development, I'm also learning to use GitHub.
