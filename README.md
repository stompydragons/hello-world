# KJ's Learning Curve

I've worked as a database/ETL developer for for over ten years, primarily working on an Oracle/Unix platform. I'm in the process of learning Python and various data science and new data engineering techniques to keep my skills current (and because it's fun). This is the repository where I'll be backing up and versioning my code as I go. Hopefully I'll be able to look back on this over the years and see my progress.

This is also a chance for me to get familiar with git and GitHub, which is very different from the PVCS version control I've been buried in for the last decade.

Folder list:

* [01_babysteps](https://github.com/stompydragons/stompy-learns/tree/master/01_babysteps "baby steps folder") - The very first python scripts I ever wrote, including the classic "Hello World".

* [02_PythonGettingStarted](https://github.com/stompydragons/stompy-learns/tree/master/02_PythonGettingStarted "Python getting Started folder") - The first course I officially took on Python (in January 2018), so the code is slightly more sophisticated than the baby steps folder but not by much!

* [03_PythonFundementals](https://github.com/stompydragons/stompy-learns/tree/master/03_PythonFundementals "Python Fundementals folder") - My second official Python course, which took me to some much more sophisticated places.

* [04_DataAnalysisShort](https://github.com/stompydragons/stompy-learns/tree/master/04_DataAnalysisShort "Short Data Analysis course folder") - A short data analysis course I took in February 2018 that made me so angry, I redid the instructors scripts as a Jupyter notebook with pandas DataFrames, which I'd learned in a course last year. Probably only valuable for making me so irritated I went off and did this work!
